# Pulse Check

A tiny uptime monitor inspired by Better Uptime - built in Rails & Vue with background jobs, monitoring logic, and real-time dashboards.

This is the frontend app built with Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia. It connects to the Pulse Check backend to display monitored URLs, statuses, and historical data.

## 🌐 Live Demo

**App:** [https://pulse-check.fly.dev/](https://pulse-check.fly.dev/)

**Demo Account:**

- Email: `demo@example.com`
- Password: `password`

> ⚠️ **Note:** The app may be slow on first access since it's deployed on Fly.io with `min_machines_running = 0` and `auto_stop_machines = true` for both frontend and backend. The initial wait time is due to machines starting up.
