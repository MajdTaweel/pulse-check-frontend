# Pulse Check

A tiny uptime monitor inspired by Better Uptime - built in Rails & Vue with background jobs, monitoring logic, and real-time dashboards.

This is the frontend app built with Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia. It connects to the Pulse Check backend to display monitored URLs, statuses, and historical data.
